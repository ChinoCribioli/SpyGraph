# SpyGraph

Imagine you are in Mick Jagger's house (yes, the best day of your life). Plus, you have a magic portal that can transport you from one house to the other instantly and as many times as you want, but with the condition that the house you are arriving must be the one of an artist that colaborated with Mick in a song. In general, the portal can take you from one house to another as long as the two owners of the houses are two artists that colaborated together in a song. Could you go from Mick's house to, for instance, Shakira's? In how many trips? And what about Madonna? Well, SpyGraph is a platform that helps us to resolve these questions.

All the instructions are in [the site](https://spygraph.up.railway.app/index.html), but here's an [example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H52bGDRrs7g).
